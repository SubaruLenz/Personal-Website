## Hello, I'm Kien

I’m a computer science student at [Swinburne University of Technology](https://swinburne-vn.edu.vn), graduating in October 2025. Over the past few years, I’ve built a foundation across software development, cloud computing, and system design — but what excites me most is bridging the gap between **building software** and **running it reliably at scale**.  

This site is my little corner of the web: a place to share who I am, what I’m learning, and the things I’m passionate about — both in tech and beyond.

### What Drives Me

I’m motivated by curiosity and the challenge of creating systems that don’t just work, but work well. Whether it’s designing a pipeline, ricing my Linux desktop, or fine-tuning personal apps, I love finding ways to make technology feel smooth, efficient, and a little bit elegant.

### Current Focus

Right now, I’m preparing for new challenges in the **DevOps and Cloud engineering space** but also open to **Software Development space**. I’m strengthening my skills with:  
- CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)  
- Cloud platforms (AWS)  
- Containerization and orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)  
- FastAPI, React, and modern web stacks  

I’m also experimenting with indie game development and keeping my coding habits sharp through personal projects.

### Beyond Code

When I’m not deep in configs or cloud tools, you’ll usually find me:  
- 🎮 Brainstorming game mechanics and tinkering with Unity  
- 🖥️ Ricing my Linux setups (Sway + Cinnamon are my current playgrounds)  
- 🎸 Listening to a wide range of music genres and strumming the guitar (still fighting with barre chords!)  
- 🌍 I'm fluent in English and wanna challenge myself with Japanese in the future
