Hi, My name is <b>Kien</b> â€” welcome to my space on the internet ðŸŒ¸
{{< /typeit >}}

I'm currently finishing my computer science degree at  
[Swinburne University of Technology](https://swinburne-vn.edu.vn)  
and graduating on *October, 2025*. Beyond the classroom, I love tinkering with Linux, experimenting with DevOps pipelines, and diving into languages and music. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.
